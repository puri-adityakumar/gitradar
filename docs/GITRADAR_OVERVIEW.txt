GITRADAR - COMPLETE PROJECT OVERVIEW
=====================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
GitRadar is a GitHub monitoring platform built for the Serverpod 3 Global Hackathon. It provides developers with a unified command center for tracking pull requests, issues, and repository activity across multiple GitHub projects. Think of it as your personal GitHub dashboard that cuts through the noise and shows you only what matters.

THE PROBLEM GITRADAR SOLVES
---------------------------
Every developer who works with GitHub knows this pain:

1. Notification Overload: GitHub's native notification system is overwhelming. You get notifications for everything - comments, mentions, PR updates, issue changes - all mixed together in one endless stream. It's like drinking from a fire hose.

2. Missed Critical Updates: Because of this noise, important updates get buried. That urgent PR that needs your review? Lost in a sea of bot comments and minor updates. The critical bug report? Buried under feature requests.

3. Context Switching Hell: If you're working on multiple repositories - maybe your main project, a few open source contributions, and some dependencies you're monitoring - you're constantly jumping between tabs, checking different repos, losing focus on your actual work.

4. No Unified View: GitHub shows you notifications, but it doesn't give you a clean dashboard view of "here are all the open PRs across all your projects" or "here are all the issues that need attention."

THE SOLUTION
------------
GitRadar provides a clean, distraction-free command center for GitHub activity. Here's what makes it special:

Selective Repository Watching: You choose exactly which repositories to monitor - up to 10 of them. No more getting notifications from every repo you've ever starred or contributed to.

Granular Notification Controls: For each repository, you can independently control whether you want in-app notifications, push notifications, both, or neither. Maybe you want push notifications for your main project but only in-app notifications for that open source library you're watching.

Unified Activity Feed: See all pull requests and issues from all your watched repositories in one place. Filter by repository, see at a glance which items are new, which need attention.

Smart Background Sync: GitRadar automatically syncs with GitHub every 5 minutes, so you always have fresh data without hammering the API.

Anonymous Mode: Want to just monitor some public repositories without connecting your GitHub account? You can do that too, though with GitHub's rate limits for unauthenticated requests.

KEY FEATURES IN DETAIL
----------------------

Authentication:
GitRadar uses GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for authentication. When you provide your PAT, GitRadar validates it with GitHub's API, retrieves your user profile (username, avatar, display name), and creates a secure session. Your PAT is encrypted with AES-256 before being stored - it never leaves the server unencrypted.

There's also an anonymous "guest" mode where you can browse public repositories without providing any credentials. This is perfect for quickly checking on popular open source projects.

Repository Management:
You can add up to 10 repositories to your watchlist. When you add a repo, GitRadar validates that it exists and that you have access to it (for private repos). Each repository card shows:
- The repository name and owner
- Toggle switches for in-app and push notifications
- When it was last synced
- Quick access to sync that specific repo

Activity Feed:
This is the heart of GitRadar. Two tabs - one for Pull Requests, one for Issues. Each shows:
- The title and number
- Current state (open, closed, merged for PRs; open, closed for issues)
- Author information
- When it was created or last updated
- Which repository it belongs to
- Visual indicators for unread items

You can filter by repository using chips at the top, so you can quickly focus on just one project when needed. Tapping any item opens it directly in GitHub - GitRadar doesn't try to recreate the full GitHub experience, it just helps you find and access what you need.

Notifications:
In-app notifications tell you about new PRs, new issues, state changes, and more. They appear in a dedicated notification center with an unread badge in the navigation bar. Mark individual notifications as read, or hit "mark all read" when you've caught up.

Push notifications (via OneSignal) can alert you even when the app isn't open. These are controlled per-repository, so you might enable push for critical repos and disable for less urgent ones.

Settings:
Simple and focused. Toggle between light, dark, and system themes. View your account information. Connect a GitHub PAT if you started in anonymous mode. Sign out when needed.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------

Backend - Serverpod 3:
The server is built with Serverpod 3, a modern Dart backend framework. Serverpod uses RPC-style endpoints rather than REST - you define methods on endpoint classes, and Serverpod generates type-safe client code automatically. This means the Flutter app can call server methods as if they were local functions, with full type safety.

Key backend components:

Endpoints:
- AuthEndpoint: Handles login, logout, session validation, PAT upgrades
- RepositoryEndpoint: CRUD operations for watched repositories, sync triggers
- ActivityEndpoint: Lists PRs and issues with filtering and pagination
- NotificationEndpoint: Notification management
- PreferencesEndpoint: Theme settings

Services:
- GitHubApiService: HTTP client for GitHub's REST API with rate limit handling and exponential backoff
- SyncService: Orchestrates fetching PRs/Issues from GitHub, upserting to database, creating notifications
- EncryptionService: AES-256 encryption for PAT storage
- NotificationService: Creates in-app notifications based on repository settings
- OneSignalService: Delivers push notifications

Background Jobs:
A RepositorySyncFutureCall runs every 5 minutes via Serverpod's scheduler. It iterates through all users, syncs all their repositories from GitHub, and reschedules itself. This ensures everyone has fresh data without requiring manual refreshes.

Frontend - Flutter:
The mobile/web app is built with Flutter, using a feature-based architecture. Each major feature (auth, repositories, activity, notifications, settings) has its own folder with screens, providers, and widgets.

State Management - Riverpod:
Riverpod providers manage all state. The main providers:
- clientProvider: The Serverpod client instance
- authStateProvider: Tracks whether user is logged in
- repositoriesProvider: User's watched repositories
- pullRequestsProvider / issuesProvider: Activity data
- notificationsProvider: Notification list with unread count
- preferencesProvider: Theme settings

Navigation - GoRouter:
GoRouter handles navigation with shell routes for the main bottom navigation. Auth guards redirect unauthenticated users to the login screen.

Database - PostgreSQL:
Six main tables:
- users: GitHub identity, encrypted PAT, anonymous flag
- repositories: Watched repos with notification settings
- pull_requests: Synced PR data
- issues: Synced issue data
- notifications: In-app notification records
- user_preferences: Theme settings

All managed through Serverpod's ORM with auto-generated migrations.

TECH STACK SUMMARY
------------------
Frontend: Flutter 3, Riverpod for state, GoRouter for navigation, Material 3 design
Backend: Serverpod 3, Dart
Database: PostgreSQL 16
Push Notifications: OneSignal
Deployment: Serverpod Cloud
Development: Docker for local PostgreSQL

DATA FLOW - HOW SYNC WORKS
--------------------------
1. Background job triggers (every 5 min) or user hits manual sync
2. Server fetches user's repository list from database
3. For each repository:
   a. Decrypt user's PAT
   b. Call GitHub API: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls
   c. Call GitHub API: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues
   d. Upsert results to database (create new, update existing)
   e. Prune old items to stay under 50 per category
   f. Create notifications for new/updated items (if enabled)
   g. Send push notifications (if enabled)
4. Update repository's lastSyncedAt timestamp
5. Return sync results to client
6. Client invalidates cached data, UI rebuilds with fresh info

SECURITY MEASURES
-----------------
- PATs encrypted at rest with AES-256
- PATs never sent back to client after initial login
- Session tokens are base64(userId:timestamp), validated on each request
- Users can only access their own data - repository ownership verified
- Serverpod's built-in security features for endpoint protection

RATE LIMITING AND LIMITS
------------------------
GitHub API:
- Authenticated: 5000 requests/hour
- Anonymous: 60 requests/hour
- Exponential backoff on 403/429 responses

Application Limits:
- Max 10 repositories per user
- Max 50 PRs stored per repository
- Max 50 issues stored per repository
- Sync every 5 minutes (not more frequent to respect rate limits)
- Fetch max 2 pages per API call (100 items max per sync)

WHY SERVERPOD 3?
----------------
Serverpod 3 was chosen for several reasons:

1. Dart End-to-End: Same language on frontend and backend. Type-safe, null-safe, familiar to Flutter developers.

2. Generated Client Code: Define your endpoints and models once, Serverpod generates the client SDK. No manual API client code, no serialization bugs.

3. Built-in ORM: Define models in YAML, get migrations, queries, and type-safe database operations automatically.

4. FutureCalls: Built-in job scheduling perfect for the background sync feature.

5. Serverpod Cloud: Easy deployment with managed PostgreSQL, SSL, and scaling.

6. Hackathon Context: This was built for the Serverpod 3 Global Hackathon, so using Serverpod was both a requirement and a great learning opportunity.

WHAT MAKES GITRADAR UNIQUE
--------------------------
1. Focused Scope: It doesn't try to be GitHub. It's a monitoring dashboard that helps you stay on top of activity and then links you to GitHub for the full experience.

2. Per-Repository Controls: Unlike GitHub's all-or-nothing notification approach, GitRadar lets you fine-tune settings for each repository.

3. Cross-Platform: Built with Flutter, runs on web, iOS, Android, macOS. Same codebase, same experience everywhere.

4. Privacy-Focused: Your PAT stays on the server, encrypted. The sync happens server-side so your token isn't exposed in client-side API calls.

5. Anonymous Option: No GitHub account? No problem. Monitor public repos with the guest mode.

HACKATHON SUBMISSION CONTEXT
----------------------------
GitRadar was built for the Serverpod 3 Global Hackathon. The challenge was to create a useful application showcasing Serverpod 3's capabilities. GitRadar demonstrates:

- Full Serverpod 3 integration with Flutter
- RPC endpoints with type-safe client generation
- Database models and ORM
- Background job scheduling with FutureCalls
- Custom authentication handling
- External API integration (GitHub)
